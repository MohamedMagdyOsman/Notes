# 🔁 Input, Output Redirection & Piping in Linux

Input and output redirection allow you to **control where data comes from and where it goes**.  
They are heavily used in **automation, scripting, and penetration testing**.

---

## 1️⃣ Standard Streams in Linux

Every Linux process has three standard streams:

| Stream | Number | Description |
|-----|------|------------|
| STDIN | 0 | Standard Input |
| STDOUT | 1 | Standard Output |
| STDERR | 2 | Standard Error |

---

## 2️⃣ Output Redirection (`>`)

Redirects **standard output (STDOUT)** to a file.

```bash
command > file.txt
````

* Overwrites the file if it exists
* Creates the file if it does not exist

Example:

```bash
ls > files.txt
```

---

## 3️⃣ Output Appending (`>>`)

Appends output to a file **without overwriting it**.

```bash
command >> file.txt
```

Example:

```bash
echo "scan result" >> result.txt
```

---

## 4️⃣ Input Redirection (`<`)

Redirects a file as **input (STDIN)** to a command.

```bash
command < file.txt
```

Example:

```bash
sort < names.txt
```

---

## 5️⃣ Error Redirection (`2>`)

Redirects **standard error (STDERR)** to a file.

```bash
command 2> error.txt
```

Example:

```bash
ls /root 2> errors.txt
```

---

### 🔹 `/dev/null`

`/dev/null` is a special file that **discards all data** written to it.

Example:

```bash
command 2> /dev/null
```

Used to:

* Hide errors
* Clean command output

---

## 6️⃣ Redirecting Output and Errors Together

```bash
command > output.txt 2>&1
```

Redirects both STDOUT and STDERR to the same file.

---

## 7️⃣ Piping (`|`)

Piping sends the output of one command as input to another.

```bash
command1 | command2
```

Example:

```bash
ls -l | grep ".txt"
```

---

## 8️⃣ `tee` Command

The `tee` command:

* Displays output on the screen
* Writes output to a file **at the same time**

```bash
command | tee file.txt
```

Append mode:

```bash
command | tee -a file.txt
```

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* `>` overwrites output
* `>>` appends output
* `<` provides input from a file
* `2>` redirects errors
* `/dev/null` discards data
* `|` connects commands
* `tee` saves and displays output simultaneously
