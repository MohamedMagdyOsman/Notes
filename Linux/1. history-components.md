# 🐧 Linux Introduction

Linux is a **free and open-source operating system** widely used in servers, cloud environments, cybersecurity, DevOps, and penetration testing.  
Understanding Linux is **mandatory** for anyone serious about cybersecurity.

---

## 1️⃣ What Is Linux?
Linux is an **operating system kernel** originally created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991.  
When combined with system tools and applications, it forms a complete operating system commonly referred to as **Linux OS**.

Linux is:
- Open-source
- Multi-user
- Multi-tasking
- Secure by design
- Highly customizable

---

## 2️⃣ Brief History: Linux vs Unix

### Unix (1970s)
- Created at **Bell Labs**
- Proprietary
- Used in enterprises and academic institutions
- Expensive and closed-source

### Linux (1991)
- Created as a **Unix-like** alternative
- Free and open-source
- Community-driven
- Compatible with Unix principles

### Key Differences

| Linux | Unix |
|-----|------|
| Open-source | Mostly proprietary |
| Free | Usually paid |
| Community-driven | Vendor-controlled |
| Highly customizable | Limited customization |

> Linux is **not Unix**, but it is **Unix-like**.

## 3️⃣ Linux Distributions (Distros)

A **Linux distribution** is a complete operating system that includes:
- Linux kernel
- Package manager
- System utilities
- Desktop environment (optional)

### Why Are There So Many Distributions?
Because Linux is open-source, different groups create distros for different purposes:

- Servers
- Desktops
- Embedded systems
- Cybersecurity
- Cloud & DevOps

### Examples
- **Ubuntu** → General purpose
- **Debian** → Stability-focused
- **CentOS / Rocky** → Server environments
- **Arch Linux** → Advanced users
- **Kali Linux** → Penetration testing

> Same kernel, different tools, configurations, and philosophies.

## 4️⃣ Why Use Linux? (Especially in Cybersecurity)

Linux is preferred because:
- Most **servers run Linux**
- Most **security tools are built for Linux**
- Better control over networking and processes
- Powerful command-line interface
- Native scripting and automation

For pentesters:
- Full control of the OS
- Easy tool installation
- Realistic attack environments

---

## 5️⃣ Linux Core Components

### 1️⃣ Kernel
- The **core of the OS**
- Manages:
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Devices
  - Processes
- Acts as a bridge between hardware and software

> Users do NOT interact with the kernel directly.

---

### 2️⃣ Shell
- The **command interpreter**
- Takes user commands and passes them to the kernel

---

### 3️⃣ Applications

* User-space programs
* Examples:

  * Browsers
  * Editors
  * Security tools (nmap, burpsuite)
  * System utilities

---

## 6️⃣ Shell Types

Different shells provide different features.

Common shells:

* **sh** → Original shell
* **bash** → Most common (default on many systems)
* **zsh** → Advanced features, customization
* **fish** → User-friendly, interactive

Check current shell:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

---

## 7️⃣ Shell vs Terminal (Very Important)

### Shell

* A **program**
* Interprets commands
* Examples: bash, zsh

### Terminal

* A **window/interface**
* Allows you to interact with the shell
* Examples:

  * GNOME Terminal
  * xterm
  * Windows Terminal

### Simple Analogy

* Terminal → Keyboard + Screen
* Shell → Brain that understands commands

> You run a **shell inside a terminal**.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Linux is open-source and Unix-like
* Distros exist for different use cases
* Kernel, shell, and applications form the OS
* Shell ≠ terminal
