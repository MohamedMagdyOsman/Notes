# 📦 Archiving & Compression in Linux

Archiving files is important because it allows you to **create backups** and **store multiple files efficiently**.

**Archiving** means collecting multiple files and directories into **a single file (archive)**.

## `tar` Command (Tape Archiver)

The most famous command for archiving is `tar`, which stands for **Tape ARchiver**.

The `tar` command can:
- Create an archive
- List the contents of an archive
- Extract all files and directories
- Extract a single file from an archive

### Common `tar` Options

- `c` → create archive  
- `x` → extract archive  
- `t` → list contents  
- `f` → specify archive file  
- `v` → verbose (show progress)

## `tar` with Compression

`tar` is commonly used with compression algorithms:

```bash
tar -czf   # gzip compression
tar -cjf   # bzip2 compression
tar -cJf   # xz compression
````

### `tar` vs `cp`

* The `cp` command **changes timestamps, permissions, groups, and other file attributes**.
* The `tar` command takes a **clone of the file**, preserving metadata.

## Compression in Linux

There are many commands available to compress files, such as:

* `zip`
* `gzip`
* `compress`
* `bzip2`
* `rar`
* `tar`

⚠️ **Note:**
All of the following commands **remove the original file** after compression **except `zip`**.

## `compress`

The `compress` command is one of the **oldest compression utilities**.

* It removes the original file
* Creates a new file with the `.Z` extension

```bash
compress -v filename
```

View compressed file content **without decompressing**:

```bash
zcat filename
```

Uncompress a file:

```bash
uncompress filename
```

> This removes the compressed file and restores the original file.

## `gzip`

A newer compression command with a **better compression ratio** than `compress`.

* Replaces the original file
* Uses the `.gz` extension

```bash
gzip -v filename
gunzip filename.gz
gzcat filename.gz
```

---

## `bzip2`

A newer compression command with an **even better compression ratio**.

* Replaces the original file
* Uses the `.bz2` extension

```bash
bzip2 -v filename
bunzip2 filename.bz2
bzcat filename.bz2
```

---

## `zip`

The `zip` command performs **archiving + compression**.

* Keeps the original file
* Uses the `.zip` extension

```bash
zip filename
unzip filename.zip
unzip -l filename.zip
```

---

## ✅ Key Points

* `tar` is used for archiving (and often compression)
* Most compression tools remove the original file
* `zip` keeps the original file
* Compression choice affects size and speed
* Archiving and compression are essential for backups and data transfer
