## `wc` — Word Count

The `wc` command stands for **word count**.  
It displays **three numbers**:
- Number of lines
- Number of words
- Number of characters

```bash
wc /etc/passwd
wc [-l | -w | -c] /etc/passwd
````

## `diff` — Compare Files

The `diff` command compares **two files** and shows the differences between them.
It tells you **how to edit the first file to make it identical to the second**.

```bash
diff f1 f2   # No output if the files are identical
```

---

## `cut` — Extract Columns

The `cut` command is used to **extract specific fields or characters** from a file.

```bash
cut -d ":" -f1,6 /etc/passwd
cut [-b | -c] 1-4,5,8-
```

* `-d` → delimiter
* `-f` → field number
* `-b` → byte position
* `-c` → character position

---

## `grep` — Search Text

The `grep` command searches for **patterns inside files**.

```bash
grep user /etc/passwd
grep -l user /etc/passwd       # check if it exists
grep -w user /etc/passwd       # match whole word
grep -ic "UsEr" /etc/passwd    # case-insensitive + count
grep ^user /etc/passwd         # starts with "user"
grep bash$ /etc/passwd         # ends with "bash"
grep -v bash$ /etc/passwd      # reverse match
```

---

## `sort` — Sort File Content

The `sort` command sorts file content **line by line**.

```bash
sort /etc/passwd                     # normal sort by first character
sort -k 4 -t ":" -n /etc/passwd      # sort by field number
```

* `-t` → field delimiter
* `-k` → field number
* `-n` → numeric sort

## ✅ Key Notes

* `wc` counts lines, words, and characters
* `diff` compares files line by line
* `cut` extracts specific columns or characters
* `grep` searches and filters text
* `sort` organizes data based on fields or values
