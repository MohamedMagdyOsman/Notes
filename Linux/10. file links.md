## 1️⃣ File Structure in Linux

A file in Linux consists of **three main parts**:

1. **Filename**
2. **Metadata**
3. **Data (content itself)**

---

### 🔹 Inode (File Metadata)

The **inode** represents the **metadata** of a file or directory.

It contains:
- Inode ID (number)
- File type
- Permissions
- Owner and group
- Timestamps (access, modify, change)
- Location of the file’s data on disk

⚠️ **Important:**  
The inode **does NOT contain**:
- The filename  
- The file content itself

---

### 🔧 Useful Inode Commands

```bash
ls -li            # Show inode numbers
stat file.txt     # Display inode details
df -i             # Show inode usage
````

## 2️⃣ Disk Partitions Overview

A disk can have a **maximum of 4 primary partitions**.

One of these can be an **extended partition**, which can be divided into multiple **logical partitions**.

### 🔧 Partition & Disk Commands

```bash
lsblk             # Display partition layout
fdisk -l          # Show partition table
mount             # Display mounted partitions
```

## 3️⃣ Links in Linux

### 🔹 Symbolic (Soft) Link

A **symbolic link** is a file that points to another file or directory.
It is similar to a **Windows shortcut**.

```bash
ln -s /path/original /path/link
```

* Has a **different inode**
* If the original file is deleted, the link **breaks**

---

### 🔹 Hard Link

A **hard link**:

* Shares the **same inode** as the original file
* Points directly to the file’s data
* Has a different filename but identical content

```bash
ln /path/original /path/link
```

If the original file is deleted:

* The data still exists as long as **one hard link remains**

---

## 4️⃣ Searching for Files

### 🔹 `locate` Command

`locate` is a **very fast** file search command.

* Uses a database (not live search)
* Database is updated by **root**
* Newly created files may not appear immediately
* Searches **only by filename**

```bash
locate passwd
```

---

### 🔹 `find` Command

The `find` command searches **live in the filesystem**.

It can search based on:

* Name
* Size
* Time
* Owner
* Permissions
* Type

```bash
find /path [options]
```

#### Common `find` Options

```bash
-name filename
-size [+|-]n
-atime [+|-]n
-mtime [+|-]n
-user loginID
-type
-perm
```

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Inodes store metadata, not filenames or content
* Linux supports primary, extended, and logical partitions
* Symbolic links reference paths
* Hard links share inodes
* `locate` is fast but database-based
* `find` is powerful and searches live
